# Quartz - League of Legends Modding Suite

A comprehensive toolkit for League of Legends modding and visual effects editing, built with Electron and React.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SETUP REQUIRED ⚠️

**Before using any features, you MUST configure the following in Settings:**

1. **Hash Files**: Hash files are automatically downloaded and managed. If missing, a reminder will appear on first launch to download them automatically.
2. **Ritobin CLI**: The ritobin executable is automatically bundled and configured. You can set a custom path in Settings if needed.

**These settings are required for most Quartz features to function properly!**
